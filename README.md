# Data Structures and Algorithms Course (Dr. Mostafa Saad – Live)

This repository contains my **C++ solutions** for the assignments of the **Data Structures and Algorithms (Live) course by Eng. Mostafa Saad**.
The goal of this repository is to document my learning journey, track my progress, and provide a reference for anyone following the same course.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

* **Data Structures**

  * Arrays
  * Linked List
  * Stacks
  * Queues
  * Trees
  * Graphs
  * Hashing

* **Algorithms**

  * Sorting
  * Searching
  * Two Pointers
  * Binary Search
  * Greedy
  * Dynamic Programming (DP)
  * Graph Algorithms

Each topic contains one or more **assignment folders** (e.g., `Assignment-01`, `Assignment-02`).
Inside every assignment folder, you will find:

* C++ source files (`Q1.cpp`, `Q2.cpp`, …).
* A short `README.md` describing the assignment, approach, and time/space complexity where possible.
